Educators can track student progress, identify common errors, and adjust instruction accordingly. Developed using modern web and mobile technologies, the system emphasizes usability, accuracy, and real-time performance monitoring. Evaluation through testing with students demonstrates improved assessment efficiency, objective scoring, and actionable insights into learning outcomes. This study highlights the effectiveness of technology-enhanced language assessment in elementary education.', 'The development of the Pronunciation Exam Application with Voice Recognition and Score Analytics effectively addresses the limitations of traditional pronunciation assessments. By automating evaluation and providing immediate, data-driven feedback, the system ensures more objective, efficient, and informative assessment for both students and teachers. User testing indicates enhanced assessment accuracy, improved student engagement, and the ability to monitor performance trends over time.\n\nFuture improvements may include integrating adaptive learning algorithms to personalize practice exercises, multi-language support, advanced analytics dashboards for teachers, and gamification features to increase student motivation. Overall, this study demonstrates that voice recognition and data analytics can significantly enhance pronunciation learning and assessment in elementary education.', 'Jovel Advincula', '[\"Sediaco, Ryan Jay F. \",\"Reymundo, Mico Jay\",\"Cenido, Russel P.\",\"Barata, Antonio R.\"]', 2, 23, '[4]', '[\"Quality Education\"]', '{\"0\":0,\"1\":0,\"2\":0,\"3\":1,\"4\":0,\"5\":0,\"6\":0,\"7\":0,\"8\":0,\"9\":0,\"10\":0,\"11\":0,\"12\":0,\"13\":0,\"14\":0,\"15\":0,\"16\":0}', 'completed', '2025-11-18 04:41:48', 16, 2024);

The system predicts potential diseases and provides recommendations for seeking medical attention. Developed using mobile technologies and secure data handling protocols, the application emphasizes usability, accuracy, and real-time response. Evaluation through testing on a dataset of medical records demonstrates improved detection accuracy, efficiency, and reliability, highlighting the potential of AI-driven mobile solutions in preventive healthcare.', 'The development of the mobile-based symptom analysis system using a hyper-tuned C-SVC algorithm effectively addresses the need for accessible and early disease detection. By analyzing user-reported symptoms and providing predictive insights, the system aids in timely medical consultation and decision-making.
